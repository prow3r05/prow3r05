### ‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®My favourite projects :) ‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®

#### [SA.CMS](https://github.com/milesprow3r05/sacms) - my mini CMS, with template support, this is the first thing I did in PHP, and I think I'll study it further :-D
#### [Krosh.Server Script 4 Ubuntu (new name KM:ServerInstaller)](https://github.com/milesprow3r05/KroshServerScript-4-Ubuntu) - I have been working with configuring web servers for a long time, and I decided, why don't I make a script for auto-installing server software? No one will give up the good old PHP5, a cool Apache, and a convenient MySQL database, right? :-) All this was written for bubunta (it's Ubuntu 18.02.4) and maybe it won't start on newer versions of ubuntu, and maybe it will :) Also, for the beauty, I added neofetch and screenfetch, it's necessary to look at the information about the server :-D
#### [Fast Wallpaper Changer](https://github.com/milesprow3r05/FastWallpaperChanger) - my share, created in Delphi 7 (Pascal) using WinAPI, although it only works with JPG and BMP...
#### [BAT Cryptor](https://github.com/milesprow3r05/bat-cryptor) - a small batnik weighing several bytes-kilobytes, which can encrypt files by using the certification services utility, since it can work with hash and HEX bytes, while the BAT file encrypts each file with the same bytes, which makes it impossible to decrypt the files back. How do you like this? üò∫
